class DeleteView:
    """
    A base view class for handling delete operations using the Manager class.

    This class provides a standard implementation for deleting objects,
    supporting both soft deletion (marking objects as deleted) and
    hard deletion (permanently removing them from the database).

    Attributes:
        manager (Manager): An instance responsible for database operations.
        lookup_field (str): The field used to identify the object for deletion.

        This method retrieves the object based on the lookup field
